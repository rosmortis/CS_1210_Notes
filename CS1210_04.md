**Boolean expression**
	derived to eliminate middle items 
	called "excluded middle"
	turns proposition into the binary "true, false"
	-
	able to build more complex experssions with *not, and , or* 
	-
	Truth table  
	--------------------------
	Expression    Truth value 
	--------------------------
	true                   true 
	false                  false 
	not true            false 
	not false           true 
	true and true    true
	true and false   false
	false and true   false
	false and false  false
	true or true        true
	true or false      true 
	false or true      true 
	false or false     false 
	--------------------------
	-
	clauses joined by "and" are called conjunctions 
	causes joined by "or" are called disjunction  
**Comparison operator**
	To compare to objects or two values with operators like +, -, <, >, and =  
	returns a boolean *true* if the comparison holds and *false* if it does not
	works for ints and float
	compares strings lexicographically  
**De Morgans Law**
	Written to give an easier way to evaluate expression (for input validation)
	----------------------------------------------------
	not (a or b)       is the same as    (not a) and (not b)
	not (a and b )   is the same as    (not a) and (not b)
	----------------------------------------------------
**Lexicographic order**
	Similar to alphabetical order 
	Where a comes before aa
	duck < swan = true
	wing < wings  = true
	bingo < bin = false 
	and where uppercase letters have lower order than lowercase letter 
	a > A = true 
**Branching**
	Used to branch programs so they don't run in a strictly linear fashion 
	this allows for more complex calculations 
	and more sophisticated programs 
	branches are accessed with *if elif and else* 
	they work closely with Boolean expressions 
	EX. 
	a prompt for the user to guess a magic word 
	of user does not guess correctly print "YOU WIN"
	if the user does not guess correctly then print "YOU LOSE"
	elif is a portmanteau of else and if so serves the same function as if but only after an else statement 
**String methods**
	If we define a string object with a variable then calling the function .capitalize() with an empty parameter will return that string object with the first letter capitalized. 
	EX. 
	s = egg
	s.capitalize 
	Egg
	The same is true for the following:
	 .upper() which returns the string in all uppercase
	 .lower() which returns the string in all lowercase 
	 NOTE: if you would like to use the returned value you may have to reassign the variable
	-
	in pracitce these would be inplemented in the "if" statement of a functon
	EX.
	response = input('Do you wan to continue enter "y": ') 
	if response.lower() == y:
	*code would continue here*
**Flowchart**
	Flow charts are a tool used to help design a strategy to begin to write code like a programers blueprint 
	**commonly used elements of a flowchart:**
	ellipses, for start or end of a program 
	rectangles, mark the start of some sort of calculation 
	diamonds, which indicate a decision 
	arrows, for process flow
**Decision tree**
	A decision tree is another way to model what you want your program to to do 
	it can only be described by a picture so google it. 
**Main** 
	 main is used to define the portion of the code that runs on start up 
	 the correct syntax for the main variable is _ _ _main_ _ _ 
	to implement main it should be placed inbetween the definition of the function 
**Assert (keyword and assertions)**
**AssertionError**
**Bug**
**Driver code**
**Dunder**
**Entry point and top-level code environment**
**Instrumental development**
**Namespace** 
**Rubber ducking**
