Some programs need to take data from another file or write data to a file. This is done with file I/O which stands for input output. you need to be able to open and close a file with this to d this you use a context manager. 

**Context manager**
	a context manger controls with happens within a 'with' statement the idiom is a s follows 
	- 
	with open("somefile.txt") as fh: 
     # do something E.G. read file
     S = fh.read()
     -
    when this block of code is executed python will close the file. 
    the operators here are **with** which creates the context manager
    and **as** that assigns the name of the file to a new variable
    **fh** is a common name it stands for file handled
    **how to use**
    -
    with open('hello.txt') as fh: 
    s = fh.read()
    -
    print(s)
    hello world!
**Reading form a file**
	often one line is read into a list at a time where: 
	-
	lines = () 
	with open('poem.text') as f: 
	for lines in poem: 
	lines.append(line)
	-
	this appends each new line with newline charters "/n"
	if you don't want to append with any newline charters you can use the .strip() method where: 
	lines.append(line.strip(/n))
	this returns with out format
**Writing to a file**
	sometime we want to store output from code somewhere other than the console this can be done by writing to a file which is dome as follows: 
	-
	with open("file.txt", 'w') as f: 
	f.write("hello world!")
	-
	'R' open for reading 
	'w' open for writing 
	'x' open exclusively for creating 
	'a' open for writing appending to the end of the file if it exists 
	'b' binary mode
	't' text mode (default)
	'+' open for updating (reading or writing)
	these can me joined together like "wt"
**Keyword arguments**
	most functions take one or two positional arguments for example math.sqrt(x) or math.pow(x, y) but some take keyword arguments like print("hello world!") where it prints to the console and append a newline charter to the end of each statement. You also have the option to append/use a different charter at the end you would simply add a comma and end=" " to concatenate one string to another or newline=" " to add a newline
**The Strip Method**
	the strip method is used when adding items to the CSV module. Because the CSV module deals with formatting you need to be sure that the things you are writing to a CSV file are clear of any newline characters or tab characters. To do this set the line equal to a variable and type x.strip() in the parentheses you can chose to specify what charters to strip like x.strip(/n) or a blank parameter will strip all 
**The CSV module**
	the CSV module is used to format tabular data in python. 
	it stands for *comma separated value format*.
	it is widely used because spread sheets can read values formated in CSV
	data written is CSV like this: 
	France, 2018
	Germany, 2019 
	America, 2020 
	China, 2022
	To read data from a file is CSV: 
	-
	import csv
	with open('bands.csv', newline='') as csvfile: 
	reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
	for row in reader 
	print(row)
	-
	Here you create a special object called called CSV reader and pass the object to the file reader. 
	-
	you can also write to a CSV file this way 
	import csv
	with open('bands.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile: 
	writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
	for band in bands  
	writer.writerow(band)
