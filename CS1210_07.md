**Monte Carlo Simulation**
**Pseudo-random**
	 The idea here is essentially that because computers compute in purely binary it is strictly impossible to generate anything random. The work arounds for this are complicated but the result is something so close to random that it becomes indistinguishable. 
**Random module**
	**random.random()** to generate a pseudo random float on the interval [0.0, 1.0]
		x = random.random() where x is assigned to a random number greater than or equal to zero but strictly less than one 
		The random random module can also be manipulated to favor sides/outcomes where 
		if random.random() < 0.53:
			print ('heads')
		else: 
			print('tails')
		This code manipulates the probability of the 'coin toss' towards heads rigging the game to set the range to be different simply apply the formula "(max_value - min_value) + min value"
	**random.randint()** to generate a pseudo-random integer in a specified interval
		rad int takes two arguments, the upper and lower bounds of the desired interval where n = random.randint(0, 100) provides a random number from 0 to 100. 
	**random.choice()** to make a pseudo-random selection from an irritable object
		random.choice(['heads', 'tails'])
		'tails'
	**random.shuffle()** to shuffle a list
		this module takes a mutable object as an argument and shuffles the values 
		it returns none 
**Random walk**
	the  random walk is an implementation of the randnom.coice() operator. Where the possion starts at zero and moves up one or down one a set number of times. An example of the values on a walk could look like (0, 1, 0 , -1 , 0 , 1, 2, 3) where the number is only moving one place at a time but lands on an random number. 
**Seed** 
	On a deeper level the way that the random module works is that it implements an algorithm called the *Mersenne twister* being that it is an algorithm it must be supplied with a number. where the fuck is the number ross? well it is called the seed and your computer takes it from the Operating system.  
	When randomness is the goal this works great but when you need to test code randomness is not the goal so you can set the seed of the code with random.seed() if you were to set the seed to 42 and repeatedly ask for an random number they would remain random but if you asked for 5 random numbers the 5 numbers would be the same.
