- **Naming Conventions**
	- Define variables with snake_case or lowercase
	- Define constants with ALL-CAPS 
	- this means DON'T CHANGE 

- **Functions***
	- Functions are the fundamental building blocks of code 
	- information hiding is where you don't look at the source code once the function is defined 
	- Composition of functions works the same in py as it does in math *print(succesor(square(n)))
	- 
 - Defining a function 
	- use def key word 
	- then name the func with those conventions 
	- add return statement 
	-  func is NOT executed until expressly called upon 

- **Parameter v.s Argument**
	-  what is included in func defintion 
	- the integer you plug into a func is the argument

You can multiply a string by an integer and it preforms repeated concatenation 
e.x 
print("good" * 3)  
goodgoodgood
