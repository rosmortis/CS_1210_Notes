**LISTS**
	"Most widely used data strutcure"
	A mutable sequence of objects (can change)
	a call to a list looks like:
	data[1]
	This returns the value at that index 
	This is also how you take advantage of its mutability
	Where mutating data look like:
	data[1] = 5 
	there are functions built into the list function here are a few
	sum(), len(), max(), min()
	were the argument is the name of the list:
	sum(data)
	use case would be calculating an average 
	sum(data) / len(data)
	use list constructor  
	ex:
	list('ross')
	['r', 'o', 's', 's']
	
**TUPLE**
	similar to a list 
	use () and commas instead of []
**MUTABLE / IMMUTABLE**
	lists are mutable 
	tuples are not 
	this means you can not change the values of a tuple but can change the values of a list 

**INDEX**
	The number you assign to a poisson within a list 
	In python a list starts with poisson 0 
	"The numbers" are also called an indices 

**SEQUENCE UNPACKING**
	can define a list or tuple with an array of variables 
	ex:
	a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
	then un packing is a simple as calling that variable 
	where a returns 1 
	this can also be done as 
	lst = (1, 2, 3,)
	a, b, c = lst 

**SLICEING**
	use : to set range for slice 
	tuple[1:3]
	returns value up to three
