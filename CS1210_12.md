	we can use .pop( ) to poop elements from a dictionary id we supply a valid key argument. 
	```
	d = {'foo': 'bar'}
	d.pop('foo')
	>>> 'bar'
	```
	additionally we can remove elements with the provided key work 'del'
	```
	pets = {'fluffy': 'cat', 'edgar': 'dog'}
	del pets['fluffy']
	>>> pets 
	>>> {'edgar': 'dog'}
	```
	NOTE: if a key is not supplied then the whole dictionary will be deleted

	Keys must be hashable this means that they must be immutable (not ordinary python objects) 
**16.6**
	if you try to grab a value at a key that does not exist PY will raise a KeyError, similar to an index error. Another common exception raised is a TypeError these occur if you were to try to write a value to a key with a mutable key.

	graphs a re a ubiquitous data strutcure. Consider the simplest of graphs where we have two town in Vermont: 
	W -------- M 
	Warren and Moretown here we have two vertices (aka nodes) in this case warren and Moretown and one edge (the line between them) this imply an connection between them. note that the edge is omnidirectional. 
	VOCAB:
	Warren is adjacent to to Moretown 
	Warren and Moretown are Neighbors 
	one way to represent this data would be an adjacency list where the town name is the key and the value is the towns adjacent to it.  An adjacency list where the keys are neighbors is called a cyclical graph accordingly a graph with out connections is called a a-cyclical graph.
