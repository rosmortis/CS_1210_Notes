**Introduction**
	This chapter is in introduction to data science and data analysis and presentation
**14.1 Elementary statistics**
	Statics is the science of gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data. descriptive statistics (most of what I am familiar with) describe an collection of data. The most commonly used formulae an descriptive statistics are mean and standard deviation. 
	**Mean** 
	 given some collection of data the mean gives the central tendency of the data represented by 'mu' the greek letter. Where the mean is calculated by: 
	 ```
	 len(data)/sum(data)
	 ```
	 The mean is a vital part of statistics but the mean of a data set in it of its self doses not give us much useful information. If we can assume that the data is normally distributed around the mean then we can describe the data with a bell curve. 
	 on the x-axis are values we might measure and on the y-axis we have probability that one might observe that value. that means that if we are in-fact in standard distribution then the mean in the value you are most likely to observe. 
	 **Standard Deviation**
	 The standard deviation tells us how far to stretch the curve across the x-axis. Stretching and compressing the bell curve. Where a bell curve with a small standard deviation has a high peak and a bell curve with a large standard deviation is perceived to be flatter.
	 Note: The area under the curve will remain the same 
	 if the standard deviation was zero then all of the values in the dataset would be equal.
	 **To solve for the Standard deviation**
	 1. Subtract the mean from each value in the set 
	 2. Square the expression to eliminate sign 
	 3. Divide the sum by the length of elements in the list
	 4. Take the square root of the sum 
	 **How to Interpret Standard Deviation**
	 Most commonly standard deviation is used to identify data outliers/unlikely observations. For example data that falls with in one or two standard deviations is likely to be observed. data that falls > 3 standard deviations away from the mean is less likely/very unlikely to be observed.
	 ```
	m = mean(data)
	std = std_dev(data)
	outliers = []
	for datum in data:
		    if abs(datum) > m + 2 * std
			    outliers.append(datum)
			    ```
**14.2 The Statistics Module**
	The python Statistics module contains many preset math functions the most common are: 
	1. mean( )
	2. median( )
	3. pstddev( )
	4. stdev( )
	5. quantile( )
	There are tons more but theses are the most common.
	**Using the Stats Module to Calculate Quantiles**
	quantiles divide data sets into continuous intervals  that each have the same probability. if the data set is divided 1/4 then each quartile represents 1/4 of the probability/distribution. this can be dome for any fraction up until 1/100 which conveniently calculates the percentage of the deviation (This is how standardized tests are graded If you are in the 80th percentile then you are better than 79% of students). This is what it looks like in code:
	```
	quintiles = statistics.quantiles(data, n=5) 
	```
	Note: that we must specify how many sections we wish to create with 'n = 5'
	once this program is finished running it prints: 
	```
	[1,2,3,4]
	```
	Now if you have a pair of eyeballs you will notice that this is only four values that is because all the values less than the first number provided are the first. In the example above all the values that fall below one are considered the first quintile. 
**14.3 Plotting with Matplotlib**
	Matplotlib is a wide array of functions that graph, plot, chart, animate, and visualize data. Matplotlib is the *de facto* tool for visualizing data. It is an external library so require installing which is different for all machines and os'. 
	**The Basics of Plotting** 
	pyplot is the essayist of the modules to use usage looks like: 
	```
	import matplotlib as plt
	import math
	data = []
	for _ in range(100):
    data.append(data[-1]
                + random.random()
                * rrandom.choice([-1,1])
                )
	plt.plt(data)
	plt.ylabel('random numbeerers(cumelative)')
	plt.show()
	```
	To save a file call the method save.fig( ) with the name you want to have for the file supplied as the argument
	NOTE: when you call plt.show( ) matplotlib opens a new window and halts the program flow until the window is closed
